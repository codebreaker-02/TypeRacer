1)Creating Reset-game event: 
    i)To reset game we have to emit an event 'reset-game' on clicking the ResetGame button at result and the event at server should reset all the data of the players and should start a new game with the same room members
    ii)ResetButton is in ScoreBoard


2)Creating Reset-Game button:


3)Giving resetting privileges to partyLeader only:


4)Game Id - Copy To Clipboard functionality



currently working:

1) So i wanted to add functionality that whenver a user completes typing he should shown the results but everyone else shouldn't and also the reset button should not be visible till the game gets Over.

=> I implemented the later functionality but the first one is yet to be done 
=> I want a mechanism that when he completes, an event should emit to the server and server should respond with an updatedGameState where that player has isCompleted attribute set to true
but currently we don't have that one, So i have to change the model
    Things Change:
    i)Changed the model and added an attribute to the players schema - isCompleted
