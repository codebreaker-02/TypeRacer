1)I am creating this app with the help of tutorial I have in the parent directory folder 

Phase - i
1)We are going to install some packages and setup the server
2)Initially i encountered an error on the mongoose.connect()
that mongoose.prototype.connect() was not accepting the callback(), it is mentioned in the docs that it does but idk (seems outdated docs)
So, to resolve this i used .then().catch() method for the connection (because it is a promiseo or you can say asnychronous call)
3)This was the first phase of the video 
4)Also In this phase we decided where to get the sample text for the typing 
(We chose quotable.io to get the random quotes from API using axios)

Phase - II
1)Now we are going to make a mongoose model for the Game 
2)Now the Game also consists of a player for which we have to create another Schema of player
3)Schema of player consists of some attributes like - nickName, socketId, WPM, currentWordIndex(the index where he is currently in the text-to-type in game), isPartyLeader(kya wo us game ka leader h, matlab kya game usne create kari hai?, why this i important? becoz he will have the special ability to start the game)
4)Now we will make GameSchema (components of game session in DB) it will consists of attribs like - words, isOpen , isOver, array of players, startTime

Phase - III
1)Now coming onto the client part
2)We will create a react app using create-react-app
3)We will install some packages such as react-router-dom and setup the routes and paths
4)After that we will make the GameMenu using simple bootstrap 
5)Here comes the functioning of the useNavigate and createBrowserHistory , i didn't focused on that much , but that is due currently!!!!!!!!!!!!!

=>SOMETHINGS TO DO

6)After that we will install a socket.io-client package and i think it is used to enable a conection between the clients and the socket server
7)and than we 




Designing The Start Button
    1) The start button will be recieving the prop of player that clicked Start and the gameID
    2) Now we will create a State variable 'showBtn' because that will decide whether the button is going to be visible n the game screen or not 
    3) As we know that only the leader of the game can start the game so we have to check for two conditions 
        i) The showBtn is true , and
        ii) player that clicked the button is partyPlayer or not
    4)
